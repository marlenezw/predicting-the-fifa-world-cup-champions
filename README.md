# predicting-the-fifa-world-cup-champions

In this tutorial you will learn how to make predictions using the Random Forest ML model. The model makes prediction based on data that it has been fed, in our case this will be information about teams playing in the Fifa World Cup. We will use data from this Kaggle link that contains information about teams participating in the world cup since the 90's until recently. We will use this data to train and test our model and then make a prediction about the game between Croatia and Morocco and the final between Argentina and France. The model's accuracy and precision were both about 70%. Please leave a comment if you have any thoughts or make a PR to change something :)
